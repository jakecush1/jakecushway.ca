    <h1>App Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Track My Hours will be an online webapp, which uses 
        firebase to store your inputs.  The app will start with an authentication page, where a 
        user create a profile and will login.  This will then create 
        a new doc inside of firebase where all the users data 
        will be stored.  
    </p> 

    <p>
        The app is aimed towards people who work remotely, freelancers,
         and people who work multiple jobs.  This could be used for 
        Web Devs, or artists; as well as administrators or social media jobs
        .  This app would benefit both the worker and the customer, 
        in that it would create a detailed work log.   
    </p> 

    <p> 
        Some features that the app will include are a start and stop 
        timer function, that a user can easily track the exact amount of
        time spent on each job.  The amount of time will be added to 
        that job, with a timestamp and the option to add a note describing
        the work that they had done. 
    </p> 

</div>    
        
<div class="firestore">

             on any device.
        </p>
       <p>

             Track My Hours.

            be stored with a unique user ID as a doc inside of the collection.

            corresponding information will be stored. </p>
            
        <p>
            The Job Title will be stored as a map inside of the userID's field.  
            The data will be stored as an array of objects, with each object containing
             the data of the users input: Hours logged, Date, Time of day, Note

        <p>

              JobTitle: [{Length:#, Date:#, Time:#, note:#}, {Length:#, Date:#,
